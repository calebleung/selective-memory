# Selective Memory
A [level select] mod for [Invisible Inc.](http://store.steampowered.com/app/243970).

## Issues

* Probably not getting all the possible values used for generation.
* * Of note, I recall seeing a difficulty value for days/hours passed which may be separate from the mission count.
* On mission completion, the items (and presumably the cash) are not saved.

## Technical

* Using a work-around to load into the level selection state
* Using a work-around to prevent the mod stuff from happening when 'disabled.'
